      <h3>About me: Samuel Coyle</h3>
      <p>I am a student at CU Boulder studying engineering (mechanical and a litte computer science).
        I grew up in beautiful Hawaii and moved out to Colorado with my family in 2012. I first flexed my
         engineering muscles my freshman year of high school by joining the robotics team there and after that I never looked back
         my intrest was piqued then and more than 800 hours later I found my calling. Still intrested and hiring check out my resume here

    <h3>This is a blog and it is my own </h3>
    <h4>Friday May 20, 2016</h4>
    <p>    This is my first blog post on this domain and hopefully not the last. Fingers crossed this blog will be updated every couple of days but that is not set in stone.
         The point of this blog is to put all of my work and thoughts and stuff in one place.
         I am currently a "rising sophmore" at the University of Colorado Boulder studying mechanical engineering and I am trying to learn more about computer science and webdesign along the way.
        I am currently trying to figure out what I want to this summer other than work for a paycheck.
    </p>
    <ul> My goals for the end of summer are:</ul>
    <ul>  - Make something cool with a raspberry pi (iot boombox, magic mirror, host this website)</ul>
    <ul>  - Break 100,000 miles at LEAST on my beautiful car by road tripping all over the place (Arizona,Massachusets)</ul>
    <ul>  - Make something to proudly display on the Relica prop forum </ul>
    <ul>  - Use google's dep learning ai for something</ul>
    <ul>  - Make this website not look like a pile with Polymer</ul>
